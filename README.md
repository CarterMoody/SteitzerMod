# SteitzerMod
 Re-add Jeff Steitzer Announcements to Halo Infinite


ROADMAP

1. Need to update image search so that once a match is made from whole screen capture, those coordinates are used to search... this will optimize search over a smaller area.
2. Add support for more kill medals and associated sounds.
3. Investigate sound files to remove leading dead-air. Will reduce perceived delay if can cut out the first .5 seconds of each sound file
